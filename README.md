### Introduction

I love Google just as much as the next person. It's quick, easy,and and efficient way to locate alot of information at once. However, sometimes when you search for one thing it can give you a plethora of information that is not pertinent to what you need or want. This is where TV Info Base comes into play. It will provide you with information directly related to a TV show you are searching for.
