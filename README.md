### Introduction

I love Google just as much as the next person. It's quick, easy, and and an efficient way to locate alot of information at once. However, sometimes when you search for one thing it can give you a plethora of information that is not pertinent to what you need or want. This is where TV Information Base comes into play. It will provide you with information directly related to a TV show title you are searching for. 

### Installation

To run this program a user needs to have access to the internet and a standard browser.

### Usage

To use TV Information Base simply type a word from a title of any TV show you're interested in. Once you type the keyword in click the submit button and a list will populate in the center of the screen. The list will display all search results which are in no particular order. As an added feature you can click the button that says "Watched" located next to a tv listing. That is just a way to mark that you've seen the show. The page will alert you that you've seen the show before once you click "Watched".

### Known Issues and limitations

This is a basic search program. It is not inteneded to give extremely detailed information for Television shows in it's current state. Perhaps at a later time more information will be made available for users to peruse. 

### Getting Help

If you need any assistance with this program please contact me at kennedy2110@gmail.com or on Twiiter/Instagram @TeInTech.

### Contributing

A huge thank you to each of the Flatiron school staff that helped me when I was stuck on a line of code or had trouble executing a concept. Special recognition to my Cohort Lead Nancy Noyes as she often planted me in front of the "I believe" button so I could confidently push it when I didn't feel so confident in my abilities to produce a functioning beginner's app.
